These measures have limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute  for the Company's results as reported under GAAP. Because not all companies calculate non-GAAP financial information identically (or at all) or use the same methodology for certain key operational metrics, the presentations herein may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies. The Company's presentation of such measures, which may include adjustments to exclude unusu al or non-recurring items, should not be construed as an inference that the Company's future results will be unaffected by other unusual or non-recurring items. Further, such non-GAAP financial information of the Company should be considered in addition to, and not as superior to or as a substitute for, the historical consolidated financial statements of the Company prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Subscription contracts include offerings for our RSC platform and related SaaS products, term-based licenses for our RSC-Private platform and related products, prior sales of CDM sold as a subscription term-based license with associated support and related SaaS products, and standalone sales of our SaaS subscription products like Ransomware Monitoring &amp; Investigation (now known as Anomaly Detection) and Sensitive Data Monitoring &amp; Management (now known as Sensitive Data Monitoring).\n",

      "Our subscription dollar-based net retention rate compares our Subscription ARR from the same set of subscription customers across comparable periods. We calculate our subscription dollar-based net retention rate by first identifying subscription customers (the 'Prior Period Subscription Customers'), which were subscription customers at the end of a particular quarter (the 'Prior Period'). We then calculate the Subscription ARR from these Prior Period Subscription Customers at the end of the same quarter of the subsequent year (the 'Current Period'). This calculation captures upsells, contraction, and attrition since the Prior Period. We then divide total Current Period Subscription ARR by the total Prior Period Subscription ARR for Prior Period Subscription Customers. Our subscription dollar-based net retention rate in a particular quarter is obtained by averaging the result from that particular quarter with the corresponding results from each of the prior 3 quarters.\n",

      "## Free Cash Flow\n",
      "\n",
      "Rubrik defines free cash flow as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less cash used for purchases of property and equipment and capitalized internal-use software. Rubrik believes free cash flow is a helpful indicator of liquidity that provides information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated or used by Rubrik's operations that, after the investments in property and equipment and capitalized internal-use software, can be used for strategic initiatives, including investing in Rubrik's business and strengthening its financial position. One limitation of free cash flow is that it does not reflect Rubrik's future contractual commitments. Additionally, free cash flow is not a substitute for cash used in operating activities and the utility of free cash flow as a measure of Rubrik's liquidity is further limited as it does not represent the total increase or decrease in Rubrik's cash balance for a given period.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Non-GAAP Subscription Cost of Revenue\n",

      "## Non-GAAP Operating Expenses (Research and Development, Sales and Marketing, General and Administrative)\n",

Rubrik defines Subscription ARR Contribution as Subscription ARR at the end of the period less: (i) non-GAAP subscription cost of revenue and (ii) non-GAAP operating expenses for the prior 12-month period ending on that date. Rubrik believes that Subscription ARR Contribution Margin is a helpful indicator of operating leverage. One limitation of Subscription ARR Contribution Margin is that the factors that impact Subscription ARR will vary from those that impact subscription revenue and, as such, may not provide an accurate indication of Rubrik's actual or future GAAP results. Additionally, the historical expenses in this calculation may not accurately reflect the costs associated with future commitments.\n",

      "This presentation contains non-GAAP financials measures, including free cash flow, which are financial measures that either exclude or include amounts that are not excluded or included in the most directly comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ('GAAP') and ot her key operational metrics used by management to evaluate Rubrik's business. These measures have limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute  for the Company's results as reported under GAAP. Because not all companies calculate non-GAAP financial information identically (or at all) or use the same methodology for certain key operational metrics, the presentations herein may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies. The Company's presentation of such measures, which may include adjustments to exclude unusu al or non-recurring items, should not be construed as an inference that the Company's future results will be unaffected by other unusual or non-recurring items. Further, such non-GAAP financial information of the Company should be considered in addition to, and not as superior to or as a substitute for, the historical consolidated financial statements of the Company prepared in accordance with GAAP.  See the appendix for a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures used in this presentation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and for descriptions of certain of our key operation al metrics.\n",

Subscription contracts include offerings for our RSC platform and related SaaS products, term-based licenses for our RSC-Private platform and related products, prior sales of CDM sold as a subscription term-based license with associated support and related SaaS products, and standalone sales of our SaaS subscription products like Ransomware Monitoring &amp; Investigation (now known as Anomaly Detection) and Sensitive Data Monitoring &amp; Management (now known as Sensitive Data Monitoring).\n",

Our cloud-based subscription contracts include RSC and RSCGovernment (excluding RSC-Private) and SaaS subscription products like Ransomware Monitoring &amp; Investigation (now known as Anomaly Detection) and Sensitive Data Monitoring &amp; Management (now known as Sensitive Data Monitoring). Cloud ARR also includes SaaS subscription products like Ransomware Monitoring &amp; Investigation (now known as Anomaly Detection) and Sensitive Data Monitoring &amp; Management (now known as Sensitive Data Monitoring) sold standalone or with prior sales of term-license offerings of CDM.\n",

      "## Average Subscription Dollar-Based NRR\n",
      "\n",
      "Our subscription dollar-based net retention rate compares our Subscription ARR from the same set of subscription customers across comparable periods. We calculate our subscription dollar-based net retention rate by first identifying subscription customers (the 'Prior Period Subscription Customers'), which were subscription customers at the end of a particular quarter (the 'Prior Period'). We then calculate the Subscription ARR from these Prior Period Subscription Customers at the end of the same quarter of the subsequent year (the 'Current Period'). This calculation captures upsells, contraction, and attrition since the Prior Period. We then divide total Current Period Subscription ARR by the total Prior Period Subscription ARR for Prior Period Subscription Customers. Our subscription dollar-based net retention rate in a particular quarter is obtained by averaging the result from that particular quarter with the corresponding results from each of the prior 3 quarters.\n",

      "\n",
      "Rubrik defines free cash flow as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less cash used for purchases of property and equipment and capitalized internal-use software. Rubrik believes free cash flow is a helpful indicator of liquidity that provides information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated or used by Rubrik's operations that, after the investments in property and equipment and capitalized internal-use software, can be used for strategic initiatives, including investing in Rubrik's business and strengthening its financial position. One limitation of free cash flow is that it does not reflect Rubrik's future contractual commitments. Additionally, free cash flow is not a substitute for cash used in operating activities and the utility of free cash flow as a measure of Rubrik's liquidity is further limited as it does not represent the total increase or decrease in Rubrik's cash balance for a given period.\n",

Rubrik defines Subscription ARR Contribution as Subscription ARR at the end of the period less: (i) non-GAAP subscription cost of revenue and (ii) non-GAAP operating expenses for the prior 12-month period ending on that date. Rubrik believes that Subscription ARR Contribution Margin is a helpful indicator of operating leverage. One limitation of Subscription ARR Contribution Margin is that the factors that impact Subscription ARR will vary from those that impact subscription revenue and, as such, may not provide an accurate indication of Rubrik's actual or future GAAP results. Additionally, the historical expenses in this calculation may not accurately reflect the costs associated with future commitments.\n",
